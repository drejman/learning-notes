## Part I. Thesis

### Chapter 1. What Is Software Engineering?
- “Software engineering” differs from “programming” in dimensionality: programming is about producing code. 
  Software engineering extends that to include the maintenance of that code for its useful life span.
- There is a factor of at least 100,000 times between the life spans of short-lived code and long-lived code. 
  It is silly to assume that the same best practices apply universally on both ends of that spectrum.
- Software is sustainable when, for the expected life span of the code, we are capable of 
  responding to changes in dependencies, technology, or product requirements. 
  We may choose to not change things, but we need to be capable.
- Hyrum’s Law: with a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: 
  all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.
- Every task your organization has to do repeatedly should be scalable (linear or better) in terms of human input. 
  Policies are a wonderful tool for making process scalable.
- Process inefficiencies and other software-development tasks tend to scale up slowly. 
  Be careful about boiled-frog problems.
- Expertise pays off particularly well when combined with economies of scale.
- “Because I said so” is a terrible reason to do things.
- Being data driven is a good start, but in reality, most decisions are based on a mix of data, assumption, 
  precedent, and argument. It’s best when objective data makes up the majority of those inputs, 
  but it can rarely be all of them.
- Being data driven over time implies the need to change directions when the data changes 
  (or when assumptions are dispelled). Mistakes or revised plans are inevitable.


## Part II. Culture

### Chapter 2. How to Work Well on Teams
- Be aware of the trade-offs of working in isolation.
- Acknowledge the amount of time that you and your team spend communicating and in interpersonal conflict.
  A small investment in understanding personalities and working styles of yourself and others can go a long way 
  toward improving productivity.
- If you want to work effectively with a team or a large organization, 
  be aware of your preferred working style and that of others.

### Chapter 3. Knowledge Sharing
- Psychological safety is the foundation for fostering a knowledge-sharing environment.
- Start small: ask questions and write things down.
- Make it easy for people to get the help they need from both human experts and documented references.
- At a systemic level, encourage and reward those who take time to teach and broaden their expertise 
  beyond just themselves, their team, or their organization.
- There is no silver bullet: empowering a knowledge-sharing culture requires a combination of multiple strategies, 
  and the exact mix that works best for your organization will likely change over time.
